"Jordan Tour Guide" 



Problem Domain

Jordan is a country with a lot to offer in term of tourism, but not much is known about the archeological and historic sites in it, and often tourists and even natives don't have enough knowledge about the vast selection of sites available to visit.




why use Jordan Tour Guide ?

in our project, we decided to help spread knowledge about most of the sites available in Jordan that are worth visiting, so that the next time you decide to make you trip to jordan, you would have many choices laid out in front of you.
and aside from that, you can see what other people review and say about any particular place so u can plan your trip in the best way possible.
